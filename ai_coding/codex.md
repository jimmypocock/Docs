# OpenAI Codex

## Description

OpenAI Codex is an AI-powered software engineering agent that translates natural language into code, executes development tasks, and manipulates files within existing codebases. It's available in two primary forms: the Codex agent in ChatGPT and the open-source Codex CLI for terminal users.

## URL/Installation

- Website: <https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex>
- GitHub: <https://github.com/openai/codex> (for Codex CLI)
- Installation: `npm install -g @openai/codex`

## Tags

## Use Cases

- Generating code from natural language descriptions
- Debugging and fixing errors in existing codebases
- Automating repetitive programming tasks
- Building prototypes from sketches or diagrams
- Creating and suggesting pull requests
- Answering questions about specific codebases
- Running tests and installing dependencies automatically

## Key Features

- Natural language to code translation with multi-language support
- Sandbox execution environment for secure code running
- Git integration for version control awareness
- Multimodal input processing (text, screenshots, diagrams)
- Configurable autonomy levels through approval modes
- Air-gapped environment for security
- Support for parallel task processing (in ChatGPT agent version)
- Multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama)

## Installation/Setup

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Set up your API key (for current session)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# For persistent configuration, add to shell config file
# For zsh (macOS):
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc

# For bash (Linux/WSL):
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Get help and see available commands
codex --help

# Basic usage with default settings
codex "create a simple Node.js HTTP server"

# Use specific model
codex --model gpt-4.1 "optimize this function for performance"

# Set approval mode for automation level
codex --approval-mode full-auto "implement pagination for this API"

# Use with a screenshot for visual input
codex --image screenshot.png "build a website like this mockup"
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# Example ~/.codex/config.yaml file

# Default model to use
model: o4-mini

# Default approval mode
approval_mode: suggest

# Custom instructions for the agent
instructions_file: ~/.codex/instructions.md

# Provider configuration
provider: openai
```

## Alternatives

- GitHub Copilot: Integrated directly into popular IDEs like VS Code, providing inline code suggestions but less autonomy than Codex
- Claude Code: More consistent reasoning capabilities and better context handling, but closed-source and more expensive
- Cursor AI: Full IDE integration with better UX for context management, but less transparent than Codex CLI
- Replit Ghostwriter: Integrated coding assistant within Replit's platform with deployment capabilities
- Devin: End-to-end software engineer agent with more autonomy and parallel instances through cloud-based IDE

## Pros/Cons

**Pros:**

- Open-source (Codex CLI) providing transparency and community contributions
- Terminal integration that fits smoothly into developer workflows
- Multimodal capabilities allowing for versatile input methods
- Configurable autonomy levels to match developer preferences
- Robust sandboxing for security
- Minimal setup requirements

**Cons:**

- Occasionally hallucinates architectural components that don't exist
- Context loading issues can lead to suboptimal code generation
- Network-disabled sandbox limits certain functionalities
- Still experimental with potential bugs and incomplete features
- Requires an OpenAI API key with associated costs
- Not directly supported on Windows (requires WSL2)

## Notes

There are multiple "Codex" products from OpenAI with similar names that can cause confusion:

1. The original OpenAI Codex model (2021, now deprecated)
2. Codex CLI - Terminal-based coding agent (released April 2025)
3. Codex Agent in ChatGPT - Cloud-based software engineering agent (released May 2025)
4. Codex-mini - The fine-tuned model powering these tools

For running in secure environments, Docker sandboxing is recommended using the `run_in_container.sh` script. OpenAI offers grants up to $25,000 in API credits for open-source projects using Codex CLI.

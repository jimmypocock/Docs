## Notes

This tutorial is particularly useful for researchers in computational neuroscience, data science, and machine learning who need to manage tabular data efficiently. The library focuses on simplicity while maintaining direct SQL access, making it ideal for those who want the benefits of an ORM without sacrificing SQL flexibility. The external storage feature is especially valuable for sharing large binary data with colleagues.

## Notes

The tutorial is divided into four main sections: Basics, Methods and Interfaces, Generics, and Concurrency. Each section concludes with exercises that reinforce learning. The interactive nature allows practicing code directly in the browser without requiring local installation.

This is the official Go tutorial and an excellent starting point for learning the language. While some concepts in later sections may be challenging for complete beginners, the self-paced format allows taking time with difficult topics.

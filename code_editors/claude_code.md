# Claude Code

## Description

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool developed by Anthropic that operates directly in your terminal, understanding your codebase and helping you code faster through natural language commands. It leverages Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI capabilities to assist with various coding tasks, from understanding and editing code to managing Git workflows.

## Use Cases

- Understanding and navigating unfamiliar codebases quickly
- Debugging and fixing code issues across multiple files
- Automating Git operations (commits, PRs, merge conflict resolution)
- Refactoring legacy code and implementing new features
- Writing and running tests automatically
- Creating comprehensive documentation for code
- Streamlining development workflows with natural language commands

## Key Features

- Terminal-based agentic coding assistant powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Deep codebase understanding without manually selecting context files
- Natural language code navigation, editing, and explanation capabilities
- Direct file editing and command execution with permission system
- Git workflow automation (commits, PRs, merge conflict resolution)
- Extended thinking mode for complex programming tasks
- Memory and prompt management through markdown files
- Multi-file code analysis and modification
- Integration with GitHub, GitLab, and command-line tools
- Support for programmatic usage through non-interactive mode

## Installation/Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites:
# - Node.js 18+
# - OS: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows via WSL
# - Active billing via Anthropic Console or Claude Max plan

# Install without sudo (recommended)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# For WSL installation issues
npm config set os linux
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check

# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project-directory

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Complete the one-time OAuth authentication
# (Browser will open to authenticate with Anthropic Console)
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Get an overview of your codebase
claude > give me an overview of this codebase

# Find and fix issues
claude > fix the type errors in the auth module

# Create a commit with one command
claude commit

# Generate documentation
claude > create documentation for the payment processor

# Use extended thinking for complex tasks
claude > think deeply about how to optimize our database queries

# Create custom commands
echo "Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS" > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md
claude /fix-issue 123
```

## Configuration

Claude Code can be configured through environment variables and project settings:

```json
// Example .mcp.json for shared MCP server configurations
{
  "servers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "url": "/path/to/puppeteer-server"
    },
    "sentry": {
      "url": "/path/to/sentry-server"
    }
  }
}

// User configuration options include:
// - DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING (for token usage management)
// - CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY (for usage monitoring)
// - OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER (for telemetry export)
```

## Alternatives

- GitHub Copilot: Integrated directly into IDEs like VS Code, but lacks the terminal workflow and agentic capabilities of Claude Code.
- Cursor IDE: AI-powered code editor with Claude integration, offering a more GUI-focused experience compared to Claude Code's terminal approach.
- Codeium: Another AI coding assistant with free tier options, but without the deep project understanding of Claude Code.
- OpenAI Assistants API: Can be used to build custom coding assistants, but requires more setup and lacks the ready-to-use terminal interface.

## Pros/Cons

**Pros:**

- Powerful natural language interface for coding tasks that works with your existing terminal and tools
- Deep codebase understanding with agentic search capabilities
- Handles complex, multi-file edits and refactoring effectively
- Integrates seamlessly with Git workflows and command-line tools
- Human-in-the-loop permission system ensures safety and control
- Extensible with custom commands and MCP servers

**Cons:**

- Currently in beta as a research preview with ongoing development
- Can be token-intensive and potentially expensive without prompt caching
- Requires active billing through Anthropic Console or Claude Max plan
- Not supported natively on Windows (requires WSL)
- Learning curve for optimal prompt engineering and workflow integration
- Limited to Claude's knowledge cutoff date for language features and libraries

## Notes

Claude Code is currently in beta as a research preview from Anthropic. It operates with a human-in-the-loop permission system for safety, requiring explicit approval for file modifications and command execution. The tool works best with an active collaboration approach where users guide Claude's approach rather than expecting fully autonomous operation.

For cost management, users should monitor token usage using the `/cost` command and consider using prompt caching if available. The `/compact` command helps manage context and maintain efficient conversations.

Custom slash commands can be created in the `.claude/commands` directory for project-specific workflows, which can significantly boost productivity for repetitive tasks.

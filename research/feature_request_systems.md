# Cost-Effective Feature Request Systems for Multi-App Companies on AWS

**AWS-native serverless architecture offers the most cost-effective solution at $0.83-$4.35/month for typical usage**, combining minimal costs with maximum flexibility for multi-app support and AI integration. For companies with virtually no budget beyond AWS resources, a hybrid approach using open-source tools and serverless components provides the optimal balance of functionality, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Top Three Recommended Approaches

### 1. Ultra-Low-Cost Serverless Solution ($0.83-$43.50/month)

The most budget-friendly approach leverages AWS's pay-per-use model with a serverless architecture that scales automatically.

**Architecture Components:**

- API Gateway for request handling
- Lambda functions for business logic
- DynamoDB for data storage
- S3 for static form hosting
- SNS/SES for notifications

**Cost Breakdown by Usage:**

- **Low (1K requests/month)**: ~$0.83
- **Medium (100K requests)**: ~$4.35
- **High (1M requests)**: ~$43.50

**Multi-App Implementation:**

```yaml
# DynamoDB Schema
PartitionKey: app_id (e.g., "mobile-app", "web-app")
SortKey: request_id
Attributes: title, description, priority, user_id, votes
```

This approach provides **complete control** over the implementation with minimal ongoing costs. The serverless nature means you only pay for actual usage, making it ideal for companies starting with low traffic that may scale significantly.

### 2. Fider Open-Source Platform ($30-$100/month)

Fider stands out as the most mature open-source alternative to commercial platforms like Canny, offering a proven solution with strong community support.

**Key Advantages:**

- **2.8K+ GitHub stars** with active maintenance
- Comprehensive REST API for AI integration
- OAuth2 support (Google, GitHub, Facebook)
- Webhook integrations (Slack, Jira, Trello)
- Docker-based deployment simplifies AWS setup

**AWS Infrastructure Costs:**

- **Minimal setup**: t3.micro EC2 + db.t3.micro RDS (~$30-50/month)
- **Production setup**: t3.small instances (~$50-100/month)

**Multi-App Limitation**: Requires separate instances per app, but can use shared RDS with different databases to reduce costs.

### 3. Hybrid GitHub + Forms Solution (Free to $50/month)

Leveraging GitHub's infrastructure with user-friendly form frontends provides a developer-friendly solution with minimal costs.

**Implementation Options:**

- **Google Forms → GitHub Issues** (free)
- **Typeform → GitHub Issues** via Zapier ($20-50/month)
- **Custom widget → GitHub API** (development time only)

**Enhanced with Tools:**

- **GitVote** app for community voting (open source)
- **GitHub Projects** for kanban boards (free)
- **ZenHub** for advanced project management ($8-12/user/month)

## AI Integration Capabilities

All recommended solutions support programmatic access for AI integration through different mechanisms:

### Serverless Architecture AI Integration

```javascript
// Lambda function for AI analysis
import { BedrockRuntimeClient, InvokeModelCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime";

const analyzeFeatureRequest = async (title, description) => {
  const prompt = `Analyze this feature request:
Title: ${title}
Description: ${description}

Provide: sentiment, category, priority (1-10),
implementation complexity, business value`;

  // Use Claude or other AI models via AWS Bedrock
  const response = await bedrock.send(new InvokeModelCommand({
    modelId: "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet",
    body: JSON.stringify({ messages: [{ content: prompt }] })
  }));

  return JSON.parse(response.body);
};
```

### API Access for External AI Tools

- **Fider**: Full REST API with JWT authentication
- **GitHub**: GraphQL and REST APIs with 5,000 requests/hour
- **Serverless**: Custom API endpoints for any integration

### Export Formats

- **JSON**: Native format for all solutions
- **CSV**: Available through tools or custom exports
- **Webhooks**: Real-time data streaming to AI services

## Implementation Roadmap

2. Create simple HTML form hosted on S3
3. Implement basic email notifications via SES
4. Test with single app

**Option B - Fider Route:**

1. Launch t3.micro EC2 instance
2. Deploy Fider using Docker Compose
3. Configure OAuth and custom branding
4. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt

### Phase 2: Multi-App Support (Week 2-3)

**For Serverless:**

- Implement app_id partitioning in DynamoDB
- Create app-specific API endpoints
- Build admin dashboard using AWS Amplify

**For Fider:**

```html
<!-- Feedback Fin Example -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/feedbackfin@^1" defer></script>
<script>
window.feedbackfin = {
  config: {
    webhook_url: "https://your-api-gateway-url/feedback",
    user: { name: "User Name", email: "user@email.com" }
  }
};
</script>
```

### Phase 4: AI Integration (Week 4-5)

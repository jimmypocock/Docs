# Looka's multi-brand policy requires separate subscriptions per brand

Looka explicitly prohibits using one Brand Kit Subscription for multiple businesses or brands, even when owned by the same person. Each brand requires a separate purchase at $96/year for Brand Kit Subscription or $65 one-time for Premium Logo Package. This strict one-brand-per-purchase policy makes Looka cost-prohibitive for multi-brand entrepreneurs compared to competitors like LogoAI, which offers progressive volume discounts.

## The exact terms prohibiting multi-brand usage

Looka's official help documentation states unambiguously: **"Each logo purchase — whether you buy a logo-only package or a Brand Kit subscription — is for one brand. If you have sub-brands with different names, you need to make a separate purchase for each brand name."**

The terms of service reinforce this restriction by limiting account sharing to employees only and specifying that access credentials allow "access to the designs using one computer at a time through the Site." The platform explicitly states **"we only allow one brand per logo download"** and users **"won't be able to make changes to the text of your company name"** after purchase.

**Limited Exception**: Looka permits one purchase only if the main brand name stays identical and sub-categories are added as slogans. For example, "CocoStyle Fashion" and "CocoStyle Beauty" could share one subscription, but "CocoStyle" and "Coco Closet" would require separate purchases.

## Current pricing creates significant costs for multiple brands

Looka's pricing structure as of 2024-2025 includes:

**One-Time Purchases:**

- Basic Logo Package: $20 (single PNG file, low-resolution)
- Premium Logo Package: $65 (high-resolution files in multiple formats with full commercial rights)

**Annual Subscriptions:**

- Brand Kit Subscription: $96/year (includes Premium Logo Package plus 300+ branded templates)
- Brand Kit Web Subscription: $129/year (adds website builder with hosting)

**Multi-Brand Cost Impact**: For an entrepreneur with five brands, annual Brand Kit subscriptions would cost $480/year with no volume discounts available. Each brand requires separate billing, account management, and renewal cycles, creating administrative overhead beyond the financial burden.

## User experiences reveal frustration with multi-brand restrictions

Analysis of user reviews from Trustpilot and design forums reveals consistent frustration with Looka's multi-brand pricing model. Users praise the platform's quality and ease of use for single brands but find the cost structure prohibitive for portfolio entrepreneurs.

**Common User Complaints:**

- "For 59€/yr you get access to one logo only" - highlighting the per-brand cost burden
- Multiple users report surprise at discovering the one-brand limitation after purchase
- Entrepreneurs with multiple ventures frequently mention switching to alternatives like Canva Pro

**Limited Workarounds Users Have Discovered:**

- Creating generic logos that could work across ventures (violates terms if brands have different names)
- Using the sub-category exception strategically by keeping main brand names identical
- Purchasing Premium Logo packages instead of subscriptions for secondary brands (loses template access)

## Official documentation leaves no ambiguity

Looka's help center provides extensive documentation clarifying their multi-brand policy. The company directs users with questions to contact customer support at [email protected] but maintains consistent messaging that separate purchases are required for different brand names.

**Key Documentation Points:**

- Help articles explicitly state the one-brand-per-purchase rule
- FAQ sections reinforce that brand name changes require new purchases
- No mention of enterprise pricing or multi-brand packages in any official materials

## Competitor comparison reveals better alternatives

Research into competitor policies shows Looka has the most restrictive multi-brand approach:

**LogoAI - Most Accommodating:**

- No explicit restrictions on multiple brands per account
- Progressive volume discount system: 40% off after 1 logo, 50% off after 5 logos, 60% off after 10 logos
- Five brands at Pro level costs approximately $177 total vs. Looka's $325

**Tailor Brands - Moderately Flexible:**

- No per-brand restrictions found in terms of service
- Subscription model ($9.99-$49.99/month) allows ongoing logo creation
- Single account can manage multiple design projects

**Cost Comparison for 5 Brands:**

- LogoAI: ~$177 with volume discounts
- Looka: $325 minimum (no discounts)
- Tailor Brands: $239.88/year ongoing

## Features valuable for multi-brand management exist but remain locked

Looka's Brand Kit Subscription includes features that would be valuable for multi-brand management:

- 300+ branded templates across all business categories
- Unlimited downloads with no monthly caps
- Automatic template regeneration when brand elements change
- Brand guidelines generator for consistent identity
- Multiple file formats (PNG, SVG, EPS, PDF)

**Critical Limitation**: These features only apply to one brand per subscription. The platform lacks folder organization for different brands, team collaboration features, brand switching capabilities, or centralized management across multiple identities.

## Limitations prevent efficient multi-brand operations

Beyond the one-brand restriction, several limitations hinder multi-brand management:

**Account Limitations:**

- Cannot change company name after purchase
- No bulk operations for managing multiple designs
- Separate login credentials required for each brand
- No shared workspaces or team permissions

**Design Limitations:**

- Template-based approach may limit unique differentiation between brands
- English-only interface with Latin character support
- No drag-and-drop positioning for custom layouts

**Administrative Burden:**

- Multiple renewal dates and billing cycles
- Separate customer support tickets per brand
- No consolidated reporting or analytics

## Licensing permits commercial use but only for purchased brand

Looka provides full ownership and commercial rights for purchased logos, which remain permanent even after subscription expiration. However, these rights apply exclusively to the single brand name purchased.

**Key Licensing Terms:**

- Full commercial and non-commercial use rights
- Permanent ownership of logo files
- Rights to purchased brand only - cannot repurpose for different business names
- No formal legal documentation provided (purchase receipts serve as proof)
- Individual design elements (icons, fonts) sourced from third-party databases aren't exclusively licensed

## Recommendations for multi-brand entrepreneurs

Based on comprehensive research, entrepreneurs managing multiple brands should consider these strategies:

**For 3+ Brands**: Switch to LogoAI for significant cost savings through volume discounts and flexible account management. The progressive pricing structure makes it 45% more cost-effective than Looka.

**For Sub-Brands**: Strategically plan naming conventions to utilize Looka's sub-category exception. Keep the main brand name identical and differentiate only through slogans.

**For Mixed Needs**: Use Looka's Premium Logo Package ($65 one-time) for primary brand and more affordable alternatives for secondary brands.

**For Agencies**: Avoid Looka entirely due to lack of team features and multi-brand support. Consider enterprise solutions from other providers.

**Contact Support**: Before purchasing, email <success@looka.com> to confirm whether your specific use case requires multiple subscriptions, though expect confirmation of the one-brand policy.

## Conclusion

Looka's Brand Kit Subscription delivers exceptional value for single-brand businesses but proves cost-prohibitive and operationally complex for multi-brand management. The strict one-brand-per-purchase policy, combined with no volume discounts or enterprise options, positions Looka poorly for entrepreneurs managing portfolios of brands. While the platform excels in quality and ease of use, businesses requiring multi-brand solutions should explore alternatives like LogoAI that offer progressive pricing and flexible account structures better suited to their needs.

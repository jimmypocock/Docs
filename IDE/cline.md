- **Terminal Execution**: Direct command execution with shell integration and error handling
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Extensible tool system to create custom integrations
- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, local models
- **Workspace Snapshots**: Checkpoint system to roll back changes at any point
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Real-time cost monitoring across different API providers
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Approval required for all file changes and terminal commands

## Installation/Setup
```bash
# Install via VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on Mac)
3. Search for "Cline"
4. Click Install on the extension by saoudrizwan

# Alternative: Command Palette
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type "Extensions: Install Extensions"
3. Search for "Cline" and install
```

## Basic Usage
```javascript
// Open Cline
1. Click the Cline icon in Activity Bar
2. Or use Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Cline: Open In New Tab"

// Basic interaction
"Create a React component for a todo list"
"Debug the error in my Python script"
"Add a database connection to this Node.js app"
"Test the application and fix any visual bugs"

// Advanced tasks
"Convert this design mockup into a working app"
"Add a tool that fetches data from our API"
"Refactor this codebase to use TypeScript"
```

## Configuration
```json
// Extension Settings (accessible via gear icon)
{
  "apiProvider": "anthropic", // or "openai", "openrouter", etc.
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here",
  "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet",
  "autoApproveReadonly": true,
  "maxTokens": 8192,
  "temperature": 0,
  "customInstructions": "Always explain your reasoning"
}

// Supported API Providers
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- Google Gemini
- OpenRouter (multiple models)
- AWS Bedrock
- Azure OpenAI
- Local models (via LM Studio/Ollama)
```

## Alternatives
- **Cursor**: VS Code fork with built-in AI, subscription-based with immediate code generation focus
- **GitHub Copilot**: Microsoft's AI assistant, great for autocomplete but less autonomous
- **Windsurf**: IDE with collaborative AI features, similar capabilities but closed-source
- **Aider**: Command-line AI coding assistant, terminal-based without IDE integration
- **Roo Code**: Fork of Cline with additional team collaboration features

## Pros/Cons
**Pros:**
- Completely open-source and free (pay only for API usage)
- Model-agnostic with support for multiple AI providers
- Autonomous task execution with human oversight
- Extensible through Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Advanced browser automation and visual debugging
- Transparent token usage and cost tracking
- Active development and strong community support

**Cons:**
- Requires API keys and credits from AI providers (ongoing cost)
- Can be expensive with high token usage for complex tasks
- Limited by rate limits of chosen AI model provider
- Requires VS Code (not available as standalone application)
- Learning curve for optimal prompt engineering
